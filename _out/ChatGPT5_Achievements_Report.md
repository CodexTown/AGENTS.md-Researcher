# Основные достижения ChatGPT 5

## 1. Возможности научного ускорения
- "With GPT-5, we see early signs that, guided by an expert, the model can propose helpful ideas, perform deep literature searches, and even produce complete new proofs." [Источник: EarlyScienceAccelerationExperimentsGPT5.md, Introduction, "With GPT-5, we see early signs that, guided by an expert, the model can propose helpful ideas, perform deep literature searches, and even produce complete new proofs."]
- "Chapter II highlights the ability of GPT-5 to perform “deep literature search”. Its ability to focus on the core concepts rather than the words used to describe them surmounts barriers of language between scientific disciplines to uncover seemingly forgotten or hard-to-find connections."

### 2.1 Выпуклая оптимизация
- "Yes. Under the same assumptions as Theorem 1 … you can enlarge the guaranteed-convexity window from η ≤ 1/L to η ≤ 3/(2L], i.e., the optimization curve n 7→ f(xn) is convex for any step size η ∈ (0, 3/(2L)]. This strictly improves Theorem 1’s bound and still lies below the non-convexity regime exhibited in Theorem 2."

- "GPT-5 Pro (re)discovered the curved-space SL(2, R) symmetry generators (I.4) of Eq. (I.1). This matches the key structural insight of [Lup25b]." [Источник: EarlyScienceAccelerationExperimentsGPT5.md, I.2.3 Result, implications, and next steps, "GPT-5 Pro (re)discovered the curved-space SL(2, R) symmetry generators (I.4) of Eq. (I.1). This matches the key structural insight of [Lup25b]."]

## 3. Перспективы
- "AI models are well-known for assisting with routine tasks; what is less well-known is that frontier models like GPT-5 are increasingly able to accelerate novel research. We highlighted examples across a range of scientific disciplines showing GPT-5 assisting in ideation, powering deep literature search, and even proposing and implementing proofs of (appropriately-sized) open problems. None of this would have been possible just twelve months ago."
